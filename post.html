          <p class="paragraph">
            When I saw the first news article about Johnny Depp‚Äôs abuse
            allegations, I quickly and intentionally scrolled past it. I
            swallowed and tried to distract myself with social media.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p class="paragraph">
            This was in May 2016, and even as a self-proclaimed feminist I
            didn‚Äôt want to accept the fact that an actor I had loved for most of
            my life could be capable of such a thing. I now know this is a
            thought process called ‚Äòcognitive dissonance‚Äô ‚Äî where a fact
            contradicts your known reality so much, your brain ignores it or
            denies it to avoid the mental discomfort it causes.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Exactly a week later, I saw <a href="#">another article</a>, this
            time from Entertainment Tonight. It included screenshots of texts to
            Amber from Stephen Deuters, Depp‚Äôs personal assistant, apologizing
            for his abuse. ‚ÄúWhen I told him he kicked you, he cried. It was
            disgusting, and he knows it.‚Äù Heard goes on to reference other
            violent incidents, all uncontested by Depp‚Äôs assistant.
          </p>
          <figure class="post-img">
            <img src="images/post-img2.jpg" alt="" />
            <figcaption class="figcaption">
              Amber Heard in Fairfax County Circuit Court, April 2022
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="paragraph">
            When I read this, a switch inside me clicked. Immediately I saw that
            this was an enabler, trying to reconcile an abuser with his victim.
            Written proof of an abusive incident, something that so few
            survivors are lucky enough to have. A new reality formed in my mind:
            Johnny Depp is an abuser.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Once the couple reached their divorce settlement, they released a
            joint statement, agreeing ‚ÄúNeither party has made false accusations
            for financial gain.‚Äù I was relieved to see Depp admitted that
            Amber‚Äôs allegations weren‚Äôt false, and assumed that would be the end
            of that.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            To my horror and disbelief, a new hashtag soon began trending on
            Twitter ‚Äî #JohnnyDeppisInnocent (which would later become the
            infamous #JusticeForJohnnyDepp). That was my first brush with the
            abuse apologists who have dominated social media over the last few
            years, swarming anyone who dares to question Depp‚Äôs innocence with
            abuse and vitriol. Little did I know, it was just the beginning.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Amber Heard never claimed to be a perfect victim. She never said she
            didn‚Äôt fight back or hit Johnny ‚Äî in fact in her 2016 deposition,
            she admitted to just that. When you are living in an abusive
            situation, your brain is in constant panic mode. You become the most
            toxic version of yourself. Like an animal backed into a corner, you
            do what it takes to survive. Amber was
            <a href="#">recorded saying to Johnny</a>, ‚ÄúPlease, I‚Äôm begging you
            to stop. I feel like I have a heart attack almost every day. You‚Äôre
            killing me.‚Äù
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <cite class="cite">Elowin Brown</cite>
            ‚ÄúIf you were being strangled, would you or would you not try to save
            your life any way you could? Ask yourself if you would encourage
            your daughters or sisters to not try to keep their lives when
            someone was attacking them yet again.‚Äù
            <p>‚Äî Amber Heard, 2021</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="paragraph">
            However, in late 2018 Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman ‚Äî famous for his
            shady links to Russian oligarchs and disinformation campaigns
            including the 2016 election ‚Äî released a statement claiming Johnny
            Depp was a victim of domestic abuse: Depp would sue both Heard and
            The Sun in the US and UK respectively for defamatory statements. And
            in January 2020, an edited, out of context audio was strategically
            leaked by Waldman. Amber‚Äôs words were both misquoted and
            misconstrued as her taunting Johnny for being an abuse victim, when
            the correct transcript and full recording hears her sobbing over the
            phone, telling Depp she thought he was going to kill her and
            refuting Depp‚Äôs excuse for his violence ‚Äî that it was a ‚Äòfair
            fight‚Äô, so he was a victim too. Waldman was kicked off the US
            defamation case for leaking evidence, but the damage was done.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Search her name on social media and you will find endless quantities
            of misogynistic abuse and victim-blaming. Other victims are seeing
            this, and thinking no one will believe them either. Bear in mind how
            you speak about this trial, and Amber in general ‚Äî every time you
            choose to call her a liar, or a gold-digger, or an abuser ‚Äî a victim
            you know will quietly decide they cannot trust you.
